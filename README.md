# CWD-EEG
 The goal of this project is to develop and validate an efficient EEG processing and classification model to identify specific Chinese words from brainwave signals, enabling language signal classification in EEG. This model aims to verify the effectiveness of feature extraction and classification methods for decoding Chinese words in EEG signals.
